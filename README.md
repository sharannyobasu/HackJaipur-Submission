I have designed a chatbot named Eliza. Eliza runs a virtual coronavirus risk scanner according to options and inputs given by the user.
Eliza is also trained to help users with queries related to the novel Coronavirus.

## Table of contents :
### 1) Platform
  Eliza, the chatbot has been made on IBM Watson. I have used the lite plan so there has been limitations.
### 2) Files
  The chatbot has been made with the help of intents, entities and Dialogs. They are included in the repository, do check into it :)
### 3) Features
#### Coronavirus risk scanner : 
Like apollo healthcare has made one, this is also a risk scanner designed and inspired from the same concept. In a span of 9 questions, the chatbot will be able to tell your chances of getting infected by the deadly Coronavirus in a scale of :

Very High
High
Medium
Low
Very Low

#### Covid-19 Queries :
The chatbot can also adress general question related to Coronavirus like its symptoms, preventions, country wise data etc.
#### Donation to PM Cares fund :
Through this chatbot people will be able to donate directly to the Prime Minister's Relief fund to help the poor in the time of crisis. 
Note : I am not involved in any kind of monetary transactions and I am not getting a single penny out of it. The entire amount will be donated.
#### Order masks, Sanitizers :
The chatbot can also help you order the higly essential safety gears like N-95 masks or sanitizers.
#### COVID-19 Mythbusters :
The chatbot can also help you with these mythbusters, providing concrete info about the reality of Covid-19. Added this to stop the spread of fake news.

### 4) Significance :
The significance of developing this chatbot is to spread awareness to all the people about the effects of the virus. Secondly, in our country, testing kits are not available for the entire population. So, in order to save testing kits only to the ones who have developed severe symptoms, I have made this chatbot so that people from their homes can run a scan. The results generated are solely based upon what the users say in response to our questions.
